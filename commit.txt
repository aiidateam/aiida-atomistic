1. modified the hubbard property 
    - to be stored in the database as list of lists, then when it is used for the hubbard cards it is loaded as list of HubbardParameters. This is just a temporary fix, the real
implementation should support the pydantic repository loading.
    - to support all the functionalities of the HubbardStructureData (for example: `initialize_onsites_hubbard` method)

Missing still the support of the Full QE Hubbard utilities, like the hp.x output parsing.

2. magnetic property implemented still with kinds: using the provided built-in methods, the kinds and the collinear magnetic configuration is generated. Magnetic QE support still in this package for now.

TODO: update the docstring of all the methods.


FIND MUON: 

Find_muon check to support the hubbard U. Only in find muon because I do not understand if you want it also in Musconv... seems not actually, like the magmoms...
So I have to understand if indeed these two parameters have to be ignored in musconv. Needed then the integration of a flag to avoid this...
